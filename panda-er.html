          Panda63<br>
          Eve Root<br>

          <br>Panda63’s wife was (and still is) dying of hypertension. This is not how he expected her to go. Even though she is only in her late 50s, and someone in their late 50s should not be dying of hypertension, she is, nonetheless, dying. Panda63 relies on the support of strangers online to find the motivation to keep on living in these trying times, and has found a friend in houstonPolicestation01 on a roleplaying site called heburkaplay.tf. Panda63 is not very interested in roleplaying, but every now and then he shakes up the site he uses for emotional satiation and goes to different chat rooms.
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01 is a teenage girl suffering from a terrible condition called “I have an eating disorder but it’s not consistent enough to be diagnosed”. She seeks the comfort of roleplaying online because she is so unsatisfied with her life situation that she feels necessity in pretending to be someone else. She got the chat room handle of houstonPolicestation01 because her father works as a police officer and his favorite singer is Whitney Houston. In reality she lives in Wilmington, North Carolina.
<br>
<br>When Panda63 and houstonPolicestation01 met online it was 11:47 in the morning for Panda63 and 5:47 for houstonPolicestation01. A clear crisp November sky would’ve greeted them outside if they had left their houses that day.
<br>
<br>Their first conversation went like this:
<br>
<br>Dear Panda63
<br>
<br>I am writing to tell you that your daughter has died.
<br>
<br>Regards,
<br>houstonPolicestation01
<br>
<br>P.S. When and if you get this letter please come to the Houston Police Station as quickly as possible. We need you to officially identify the body.
<br>
<br>
<br>Dear houstonPolicestation01,
<br>
<br>I do not have a daughter.
<br>
<br>Sincerely,
<br>Panda63
<br>
<br>
<br>Dear Panda63,
<br>
<br>You’re supposed to play along. That’s the point. If you don’t play along then why am I contacting you? Anyways, your daughter has died.
<br>Her name is Sarah Panda63 and she is very pretty. She was hit by a car veering out of the way of some ducklings. She was wearing a skirt and blouse. She had long hair. Does any of this sound familiar?
<br>
<br>Regards,
<br>houstonPolicestation01
<br>
<br>
<br>Dear houstonPolicestation01,
<br>
<br>That sounds like her alright. Was it a flowy linen skirt that fell just above her knees? One with little embroidered daisies on it? Oh no. She hasn’t been home in two days! That must be her. I will be right over to the station.
<br>
<br>Sincerely,
<br>Panda63
<br>
<br>
<br>Dear Panda63,
<br>
<br>We appreciate your cooperation.
<br>
<br>Regards,
<br>houstonPolicestation01
<br>
<br>
<br>Panda63:
<br>
<br>This is pretty boring.
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01:
<br>
<br>Why are you on this website if you don’t want to roleplay?
<br>
<br>
<br>Dear houstonPolicestation01,
<br>
<br>I am afraid I can not come to confirm my daughter is dead. My wife has hypertension and I can not spare a moment to be away from her. It is getting very bad and she might pass away any day now.
<br>
<br>Sincerely,
<br>Panda63
<br>
<br>Dear Panda63,
<br>
<br>What a tragedy. Your daughter could also use a little respect for the 22 years she lived on this planet. Why can you not spare a second for her?
<br>
<br>Regards,
<br>houstonPolicestation01
<br>
<br>After this Panda63 does not reply for 6 days. By the time he replies to her, he is nearly 100% certain that she will not answer because she has forgotten he existed. He has also talked with three other people, shared quite personal information, and then ghosted them. He does not know why he keeps heburkaplay.tf open on his computer, the tab taunting him as if to say that he has left something unfinished and queasy, even though he does not know what he owes to houstonPolicestation01.
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01 has been sleeping most of the day away. She goes to school and does her homework to some degree, but after that she cannot be bothered with the living realm. She has also kept the tab in which she had talked to Panda63 open. Her father has been working late at the station, so she has been eating steamed broccoli for dinner every night. After that she sleeps again. When Panda63 responds, she is munching on slightly overdone steamed broccoli while watching a diet vlog on youtube.
<br>
<br>Panda63:
<br>
	<br>My wife really is dying of hypertension.
<br>
<br>It is 2:33 for Panda63 and he has just finished an oily grilled cheese for lunch and some canned tomato soup. It is a very nostalgic combo for him. It is 8:33 for houstonPoliceStation01 and she can barely hold herself up because she is so tired.
<br>
<br>Dear Panda63,
<br>
<br>I’m sorry. That must be very hard for you. But if you can spare time, please come down to confirm that the body is your daughter’s, Sarah Panda63.
<br>
<br>Regards,
<br>Houston Police Station
<br>
<br>Panda63:
<br>
<br>I’m not joking.
<br>
<br>But houstonPolicestation01 does not see this. Her father has just texted her, and this is what it says:
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01’s father (who will from now on be called hPs01f): “I get a day off tomorrow, so I was thinking i could sign you out of school and we could get something to eat and go to the arcade or something? Sound good bud?”
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01: “Okay :). I’m really tired though so I’m going to bed now. When will you be home?”
<br>
<br>hPs01f: “Around midnight I think. Goodnight bud”
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01: “ok goodnight.”
<br>
<br>Panda63 is also occupied. His wife’s blood pressure has spiked and he is now calling the doctor to make sure that she does not need to go to the hospital. Their conversation goes like this.
<br>
<br>Panda63: “Her blood pressure’s just spiked to the highest it’s been in a long time. 160/100. Should I bring her to the hospital?”
<br>
<br>Panda63’s wife’s doctor: “Definitely come in.”
<br>
<br>Panda63: “Alright. See you there.”
<br>
<br>Panda63 waits by his wife’s bedside for the entire night during which her blood pressure levels rise and lower. She seems nearer to death than ever before. She has not been discharged, and at 3:01 in the morning Panda63 goes back to his house to grab a change of clothes and some toiletries.
<br>
<br>At 3:23 he is nearly ready to go back. He stands up from his wife’s bed and looks at the t-shirt in his hands, a soft, worn-thin, pliable piece of cloth so fragile a wave of despair and quiet passes through him. He starts to bawl.
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01 takes a shower after she says goodnight to her father. Afterwards, right before she climbs into bed, she thinks to check heburkaplay.tf once more. She sees Panda63’s message.
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01:
<br>
<br>I haven’t eaten anything but steamed broccoli and jello since last week on Sunday.
<br>
<br>Then she climbs into bed and passes out. When she wakes up, her father has made her pancakes and has set the table for both of them very nicely, and she pretends that she feels sick. This means that they will not talk together over breakfast.
<br>houstonPolicestation01 knows this and it is terrifying, that she will always have to refuse breakfast and will never talk to her father again. Afterwards, when she is alone, she recalls the sad and worried expression on her father’s face and she feels very sad. She feels like she has disappointed him.
<br>
<br>Panda63 has been browsing the internet for about an hour by the time he checks heburkaplay.tf and sees that houstonPolicestation01 has responded. He adjusts his glasses, and then types slowly:
<br>
<br>Panda63:
<br>
<br>You should eat something more. You must be very hungry.
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01 hears the notification bell and responds:
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01:
<br>
<br>I’m fine. Steamed broccoli tastes good if you add a lot of salt and some pepper.
<br>
<br>Panda63:
<br>
<br>I don’t think that’s good for you.
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01:
<br>
<br>I don’t either. But I’d rather do this than the alternative.
<br>
<br>Panda63:
<br>
<br>What’s the alternative?
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01:
<br>
<br>I don’t know how to describe it. Anyways, how’s your wife?
<br>
<br>Panda63:
<br>
<br>She’s dying.
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01:
<br>
<br>I forgot to say I’m sorry the first time you mentioned her condition. I’m sorry, that must be hard.
<br>
<br>Panda63:
<br>
<br>I’m not sure. It’s a lot more lonely than anything else I’ve experienced in my life.
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01:
<br>
<br>Yeah.
<br>
<br>Panda63:
<br>
<br>I have to go to the hospital to be with her now. You should eat something. Like rice. Rice is good for you and it’s easy on the stomach. My wife eats rice when she feels too lightheaded and nauseous.
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01:
<br>
<br>Maybe I will. Good luck.
<br>
<br>Panda63:
<br>
<br>Thank you.
<br>
<br>
<br>When houstonPolicestation01 and her father go out for lunch and to go play at the arcade, she orders a side of rice. She eats two spoons of it. It’s mushy and cold, but Panda63 was right, it doesn’t hurt her stomach. Her father gets mac and cheese and she takes a bite of that too. They talk about school and work and their problems. Neither of them are completely honest about their problems, but they tell each other enough to be sympathetic to each other. houstonPolicestation01 feels just about the same as she did at breakfast, but in a little different way.
<br>
<br>Panda63 gets to the hospital, where his wife is still laying in the same position he left her in. She looks pale and weak. A nurse walks in to check her vitals. Nothing has changed.
<br>
<br>houstonPolicestation01:
<br>
<br>I got rice today for lunch. I didn’t eat much of it because it was mushy and not very good, but it didn’t make my stomach hurt. My father is making chicken and vegetables for dinner and some rice. I asked him for the rice.
<br>
<br>
<br>Panda63 expects his wife to die any day now, because the doctors tell him that she will. He does not know what to do, and so he sits by her bedside and does not do anything. Panda63 does not respond ever again. The last time they talked his computer updated automatically and all his browser tabs were closed. This may have been irrelevant since he was not especially planning on talking to houstonPolicestation01 again.
<br>
<br>This does not weigh on houstonPolicestation01’s mind a lot either. There are thousands of other people to chat with online. After her father makes her chicken and vegetables and rice, she starts on a week-long stretch of binge eating. Then she throws up all the food. Her father has been coming home late again from the station. When he comes home one night, he looks into her room and sees the floor full of snack food wrappers. He feels like he has failed and does not know what to do. Then houstonPolicestation01 starts eating only steamed broccoli again.
