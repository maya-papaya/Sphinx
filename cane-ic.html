          An Ending for Electra<br>

              <br><em>[Scene: The tomb of Agamemnon. Enter Electra and Chorus]</em><br>

              <br>ELECTRA
              <br>O Hermes of the nether world, hear my prayer as I pour these sweet-scented libations, and let me invoke my father once more, just as I did on the day Orestes returned to Argos. O Father, they say that the trial has occurred, that justice has been served, that Orestes is now free from judgment. The Furies, those savage ghouls, no longer torment him; the miseries of Agamemnon’s house have finally been put to an end. But no! Have I even been given a fate? How will I be judged? Even though I do not regret the murder of that foul adulteress at all, guilt is an inescapable fate. Will my guilt be recognized, and will my destiny be resolved?
              Such are my prayers and laments.<br>

              <br>CHORUS
              Receive these libations, and hear these prayers. Free Electra from her miseries.

              <br><em>[Prayer concludes]</em><br>

              <br>ELECTRA
              <br>Ah, there is the lock of hair from Orestes! That very day when we were reunited was the beginning of an end for the both of us. We contrived the plan of murder together, and we were joined as one in our bloodlust. Indeed, Orestes believed that only he was destined for judgment. “I will kill them myself, and I will die!” Yet he did not recognize my presence, my pain, my alienation.
              <br>
              <br>CHORUS
              <br>What recognition are you hoping for? You did not clench the bloodstained knife—you did not even witness your mother’s killing.
              <br>
              <br>ELECTRA
              <br>You don’t lie, my handmaidens, when you say that I did not plunge the knife into her heart. But I was burning with vengeance when my father was killed. I despised my mother and her lover; they treated me like a slave. And I saw the chance for murder the moment I set eyes on Orestes.  I was bloodthirsty. I could have killed both of them myself.
              <br>
              <br>CHORUS
              <br>But, my child, justice can not be attained unless for just reasons. We do not see the justice in punishing you; you never acted on your murderous desires.
              <br>
              <br>ELECTRA
              <br>And my guilt should be ignored? Shamefully pushed aside? Why can Orestes’ mind be put at ease, while my own has not been thought to exist for even a moment? Is Electra completely neglected?
              <br>
              <br>CHORUS
              <br>Electra, the Furies did not pursue you for a reason! They do not see the guilt in your heart.
              <br>
              <br>ELECTRA
              <br>Then let them reconsider, for surely my heart does not lie to me. O Furies, three sisters of vengeance, if you truly deserve the title of “the Gracious Ones,” hear my prayers and grant these wishes with your divine grace. Look at me, stare down my soul, and see my deepest guilt. Judge me so that I may finally lay hold of my fate. Am I, unlike Orestes, without a fate? Am I not worthy of judgment?
              Such are my prayers and laments.
              <br>
              <br>CHORUS
              <br>You are making a terrible mistake, poor child.
              <br><em>[Short pause]</em>
              <br>So? Do you see the Furies? Do you see their eyes dripping in blood, just as Orestes did?
              <br>
              <br>ELECTRA
              <br>Nothing. Just wait, they are coming, they must be coming!
              <br>
              <br>CHORUS
              <br>They heard your prayer, but I don’t see that they will find any guilt in you that is worthy of judgment.
              <br>
              <br>ELECTRA
              <br>No! That can’t be!
              <br>
              <br>CHORUS
              <br>Release yourself, you are free!
              <br>
              <br>ELECTRA
              <br>I can’t move at all; freedom is slipping away.
              <br>
              <br>CHORUS
              <br>Accept your fate. What a favorable fate it is!
              <br>
              <br>ELECTRA
              <br>Favorable? Favorable if you enjoy a distressed mind, a paralyzed tongue, a chest pierced by sharp breath with every inhalation. It’s as if I am already tormented by the Furies, but no judgment seals my fate. This is the life I live right now, and I want nothing more of it!
              <br><em>[Electra turns to the audience]</em><br>
              <br>Let Electra have her ending! Let Electra have what she deserves! And if the Furies refuse to enact my destiny, then I myself will.
              <br>
              <br>CHORUS
              <br>Electra, what is the meaning of this?
              <br>
              <br><em>[Electra unsheaths a knife]</em><br>

              <br>ELECTRA
              <br>Electra, now free, bids you farewell.
