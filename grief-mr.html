          The Idiot’s Guide to Grief
<br>Maya Reddy<br>
<br>Grief is strange,
<br>So I’ll walk you through it.<br>

<br>You’ll start by sobbing about a scraped knee,
<br>The wound, a sickly shining red.
<br>You’ll move on to tantrums,
<br>Screaming for ice cream, toys, or even that pretty earring Mom always
wore.
<br>You’ll then advance:
<br>Up to missing your grandparents,
<br>Wailing at the airport as they disappear into the crowds.
<br>And that will be it, if you’re lucky.<br>

<br>And then she’ll collapse on the floor.
<br>And they’ll say it’s just a checkup.
<br>But you know what’s going to happen,
<br>Because it happens in the movies.
<br>And you’ll see her frail scrawny body,
<br>Wrapped in your bright pink robe with unicorns.
<br>And you know Dad will never get to say goodbye,
<br>And your heart aches at that thought.
<br>And you’ll pull out of the parking lot,
<br>Never forgetting the dark grey-blue sky and red shining stoplight.
<br>And you’ll force tears at home when the deed is done,
<br>Because you think there’s something wrong with you for not crying.
<br>And the health center will give you cards and pamphlets to guide you,
<br>And you’ll begin addressing letters to ‘Rainbow Bridge’,
<br>Because that’s where they said she’ll go.
<br>And the next day, probably at school,
<br>You’ll meander into the bathroom and your shock dissipates,
<br>So you’ll weep there for awhile, staring out of the window through
blurry tears.
<br>And you’ll play ‘Heart and Soul’ on the piano.
<br>And you’ll spread her ashes at the bottom of a tree,
<br>Only to find a year later that the tree is infested with disease
<br>And is slowly dying.
<br>And then you’ll question what grief is and what love is,
<br>If you really feel anything.
<br>And everyone else moves on and tries to wake you from this stupor,
<br>Saying you need to stop.
<br>And they’ll move her favorite couch to the basement,
<br>Then donate her sparkly bed where you used to sit with her.
<br>And eventually you’ll move on and wonder at
<br>How fickle your feelings are.<br>

<br>And one day after all those storms have passed,
<br>You’ll happen across the planks in front of the steps.
<br>And you’ll see little paw prints scattered here and there,
<br>And you know it’s her footsteps impressed in the varnish.
<br>And you’ll be able to smile a little.
<br>It’s a start.<br>

<br>You’re welcome.
<br>This is just a warning, a meager description of all the messiness that
awaits you.
<br>I give this to you as a gift so you don’t feel so confused.
<br>Because doubting yourself is the first step on that slippery slope.
<br>Trust me,
<br>I would know.
