          Down By The Bay Where The Watermelons Grow…
          <br>By: Sadie Grey Murphy<br>

          <br>“Somewhere on Cape Cod”<br>

          <br>Some place small there’s a stand alone house.
          <br>It’s painted with sweat and the sound of dragonflies swimming in the sun.
          <br>It faces away from the people with their hearts, and towards the sea.
          <br>It’s chilly there, like a japanese summer in july.
          <br>Time passes strangely as a cat whispers on the front doorstep.
          <br>Visitors come as frequently as the seasons.<br>

          <br>“The Uninvited Guest”<br>

          <br>There’s a room kept separate from the rest of the house.
          <br>The light there refracts at an angle that makes the shadows dance.
          <br>The walls are painted the color of a sigh that vanishes into the huckleberry floor.
          <br>On a table, in the back corner (a little left of center) stands a swan.
          <br>Her poise is known to the portrait, whose eyes follow her and her felicity.
          <br>Air floats in from the hole in the ceiling and reminds her she must take flight.
          <br>And when she leaves, the mice wedged under the floorboard miss her.<br>

          <br>“The French Sailor”<br>

          <br>A little boy lives here during the summers and he wishes that meant forever.
          <br>He daydreams in the itchy tall grass next to the meadowlark’s nest.
          <br>He watches the boats go by and thinks that someday that will be him.
          <br>The water sparkles as he dips his toes into the edge of its promise.
          <br>He chases the wind for a hat that’s printed with the life he’ll have ahead of him.
          <br>It's full of his hopes and his smiles and it costs him his happiness.<br>

          <br>“The Shy Sailor”<br>

          <br>As he grows older, the boy covers his face with his skin.
          <br>He’s got a small model boat that accompanies him and his fears.
          <br>They travel together like water and a waning moon.
          <br>Their background is the sea and the waves which surround them.
          <br>You can hear their calls from the inside of a tulip shell if you listen closely.<br>

          <br>“The Race”<br>

          <br>One day he’s a boy and the next he’s a man.
          <br>He’s still young and new in the world and he finds comfort in the water.
          <br>He likes being swallowed by its vastness and wholeness.
          <br>Now, he’s got a list of friends that’s longer than the chain of an anchor.
          <br>They would go out to sea for lunch on the island tucked away from the eyes.
          <br>And one day their boat tipped over, sinking from the weight of their screams.
          <br>And the man was a was.<br>

          <br>“She’s Gone”<br>

          <br>Thousands upon thousands gathered near the edge of the water.
          <br>Sand covered up the dying grass a little beyond where he used to play.
          <br>They were strangers but friends, all knowing each other were knowing.
          <br>They brought smiles and hope and pieces of him.
          <br>They were his great grandmother or his fifth cousin.
          <br>They were his millions of  hearts, facing where he had left them.
          <br>As maybes and laters and tiny grains of sand.
