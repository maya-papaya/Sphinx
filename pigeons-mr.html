          Before All the Pigeons Disappeared

          <br>Maya Reddy<br>

          <br>We used to go to the temple every trip we made to Atlanta — that is, until the pandemic
          struck and our parents laid down the law.
          <br>Before leaving, my grandmothers would braid my freshly washed hair, placing bejeweled
          “bottus” centered between my eyebrows. The stiffly stitched fabric of my langas would abrasively
          rub against my skin, causing pink sores to bloom across the undersides of my arms. The temple
          stood between liquor and waxing stores, its sanctity guarded by scrawny trees bordering the
          parking lot where flocks of pigeons gathered to mindlessly peck at the ground. The ornately
          molded exterior of the building was cleaved by a passageway scattered with mats and cobwebs.
          Beaten-up sneakers and sequined high heels were stuffed into the cubbyholes lining the corridor,
          coldly illuminated by the light filtering through the entrance.
          <br>The temple was a dingy, dimly-lit place. Faded maroon carpets barely hid the grains of
          sand and rice, and the dust that clung to the soles of our bare feet. Posters of Hindu divinities
          were plastered haphazardly to the lobby’s walls, the color scheme obsessively gravitating towards
          rainbow gradients. Two stout glass cabinets proudly strutted the temple’s treasures for the public
          to admire. The stone statues of sages and their palanquins were garlanded with orange flowers,
          their faces eroded to indecipherable grooves. The children, whose families had dragged them to
          the temple, chased each other around the squatting, praying adults. In timely intervals, the priest
          would gather everyone into an elongated alcove lorded over by a divinity’s stony presence. The
          dark green tiles had seemed to ripple in the reflections of the wick’s flame. As the priest glided
          solemnly along the line, I would clumsily force my fingers into the ordained position for
          accepting blessed water. When they handed me a mixture of almonds, sugar crystals, and raisins,
          I would carefully quarantine the raisins from the rest and hand them to my grandparents to eat
          instead.
          <br>In the deserted regions of the building, where wedding ceremonies took place, chairs and
          tables made of depressing gray plastic rested on walls smeared with mustard-yellow stains. The
          carpets were carved out into pieces, some lifted back to expose strange clumps clinging to the
          frayed strands. A column, having the texture of frozen oatmeal, interrupted a length of carpet
          near the salt-and-pepper marble floor. Water fountains overhung grime that collected in the
          grooves of the tiles. In the upper floor of the building, the rooms were condensed. The windows
          gingerly hovered above the carpet, so I would have to crouch in order to gaze outside. The

          atmosphere was stifling, the portable fan barely providing any relief. Periodically, I would have
          to exit the room to refocus my dizziness.
          <br>We used to pray by also walking around the building, winding about the domes crowned
          by a divinity I could never see — stalked by the pigeons nestling in the crannies of the structure. I
          would trail after my grandmother, attempting to keep up with her long strides. Dirt rested in the
          folds of the moldings, speckling the white paint with shades of brown. The ground was a collage
          of muddied puddles and decomposing leaves, which I avoided like the plague, gathering my skirts
          anxiously to prevent any staining. Eventually we would hurry inside, though I’m not sure what
          we were hurrying from.
          <br>The cafeteria was mayhem. Voices reverberated across the beige walls. The steady stream
          of hungry bellies would accumulate round the tables and the buffets. My grandparents would
          hand me compartmentalized styrofoam trays, flimsy beneath the weight of the curries plopped
          into them. I ate quietly, avoiding speaking to anyone or engaging in a conversation longer than a
          nod. We would tramp across the floor to the door operated by an icy metal bar, leaning into it
          until the door creaked open, walking into the cleft once more, and out into the dusky beams of
          sunlight shimmering across the surface of our car. Surrounding the front entrance of the building,
          hoses lay deserted on the sidewalks, leaking water like tears.<br>

          <br>There used to be pigeons, but I don’t see them anymore.
