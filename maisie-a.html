          Dear Ms. Maisie<br>

<br>Dear Ms. Maisie,<br>

<br>I know it’s been a while. I wish I had written this letter sooner but I needed to find myself for a little bit. I have struggled these past two years and I believe a part of me is still lost, but I’m on the road to finding it. I don’t really know how to write a letter properly so I’m sorry if this seems awkward, but I just wanted to keep you updated on my life.
<br>
<br>Firstly, it’s October 14, 2022, and I am in my 3rd year of high school. You would always say that junior year was the worst year of high school and I’m starting to think you’re right. I have mountains and mountains of homework and lacrosse doesn’t make it easier. APs suck and I’m really anxious for my SAT/ACT (oh wait am I not supposed to use slashes in letters? ) anyhow, I’m supposed to take the tests in may. My mom has made sure that I have all the studying books needed but I’m still stressed. You’ll be happy to hear that my grade point average is 3.9 and I have all As except one B (you know how Ms. Roberta is) This year I have history with Mr Micheal and I don’t know if you remember him, but he has nothing on you. We all miss you.
<br>
<br>Secondly, I wanted to update you on the class. It’s been almost 2 years since the incident but everyone’s doing pretty okay. Maya is valedictorian (I know you’re not shocked) and Tyson is now the captain of the debate team. Nevaeh and Lia are doing okay too, they play on the volleyball team and Jason volunteers at the Library in his free time. Because it’s been almost 2 years, on Friday we were all invited to the cemetery to pay our respects to Jaden and Chloe. My mom says I should go but I still don’t think I can see their faces again. I think I’ll go anyway though because they deserve it.
<br>
<br>Finally, I wanted to update you on what happened after the shooting. I know it’s a little late because this all happened when I was 14 and I trust that you’re watching us from your cushy seat in heaven, but I wanted to give you a different perspective. I don’t know if you remember this, but after you hit the man and he shot, the cops rushed in. They grabbed him but I knew that it was too late. I didn’t have a good view because I was trying to shield Lia from under the desks and there was a lot of screaming but he yelled something and then there was another gunshot. The cops killed him right after he killed you. They didn’t tell us his name and he died after he killed 2 students and 1 teacher. I didn’t know how to feel at that time. I was numb. Looking back, I still don’t know how to feel about the fact that he died and didn’t serve the rest of his miserable life in prison. I don’t know how to feel. But I’m in therapy so I’m doing better. A few days after the incident they held yours and Jadens and Chloe’s funeral. I think over 200 people came, everyone in our 9th grade history class came too, well, almost everyone. It read on your tombstone “Maisie Grace Thompson, 1981 - 2020, the kindest teacher, who was loving and generous to all, gave her life for her students and she is an inspiration to us all. May she rest in peace.”
<br>
<br>I will never forget what you did for us.
<br>
<br>Goodbye, Ms Maisie,
<br>
<br>Jonathan Hale
