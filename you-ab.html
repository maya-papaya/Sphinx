          You
<br>by Allegra Bockhaus<br>

<br>You are only to me as how, when, i have experienced you
<br>Layers more of your soul sit within you and even more you have sprinkled
<br>Like sugar
<br>Into the world, the scar on your mothers stomach, the cashier who walks in with a frown but leaves with a smile
<br>
<br>And some layers you have shown me, opening like a rose
<br>The stories you have told me of the family that you chose
<br>Some layers i have peeled back, like skin off bones
<br>The conversations i've overheard while you sit with telephones
<br>
<br>Some have come easy, crumbling from you like pastries
<br>Your chipped tooth chipper smile chipping away at my heart
<br>Some I will never know, will melt into you like silent film
<br>Dissipating as they lay you in your grave
