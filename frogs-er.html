          Frogs for Everyone<br>
          Eve Root<br>
<br>
<br>Frogs for Everyone was a company that relinquished all known order in the universe to profit and corporate irresponsibility. There were big frogs, little frogs, frogs pumped full of steroids, ones with eyes on their stomachs and seven limbs, and ones that you could customize online before they took your order and sent it to you in 3 months time. Next year, you would be able to buy a Create-your-Own-Frog kit to electrically stimulate a frog cell to grow, with instructions on how to create the limbs and colors. Growth hormones and stimulants were sold separately.
<br>“Alright everyone!” Carl Sajaster began the morning meeting like this everytime, with his right fingers pressed into their corresponding left ones. His coffee sat at his left elbow, dangerously close to being knocked off at a moment of epiphany or disgust.
<br>“This begins our morning meeting on the 24 of April. What is on the agenda today Ms. Silverstein?”
<br>“We’re having some difficulty finding a suitable manufacturer for this project. We haven’t had one that is willing to have the temperature turned down ten degrees. It’s not suitable for the cells.” Ms. Silverstein placed her hands on top of each other as she did when she was pretending to care about what was going on.
<br>“What about the manufacturers we have contracts with?”
<br>“They don’t have suitable equipment for our purposes this time. Oh, and,” Ms. Silverstein added as she straightened in her seat. “The FDA is having problems with our use of sending out potentially dangerous hormones to children.”
<br>“We have them sign a waiver don’t we? They need parental consent.”
<br>“Yes, but children often do stupid things.” Ms. Silverstein had two children of her own.
<br>“Get me an appointment with Max and Johnny. They’ll settle on something with the bastards.” Max and Johnny were the best two company lawyers. They played golf and water polo with Sajaster sometimes.
<br>“Damn kids,” Sajaster muttered loud enough for everyone to hear.
<br>Carl Sajaster didn’t really mean this of course. He had a daughter who he doted on unrelentingly, much to his wife’s annoyance, who was lovingly strict, and did not give in to puppy eyes or feigned innocence. He cared very much for his family, and children in general, but it was a pain in the ass for their projects to always be delayed with manufacturing incompetency, the feds always having a problem with their use of synthetic hormones, and animal welfare organizations trying to ruin the company altogether. Sajaster didn’t even know why they tried anymore. The company always won their cases. There was a demand for genetically edited animals and Frogs for Everyone filled them.
<br>“Are the labs making any progress with the slugs?” Sajaster resigned to talking about things he knew there would be good news about. He turned to a bored looking young man.
<br>“The lab succeeded in making them grow to about 3 feet in length by electrically manipulating their liquid-liquid-phase separation, but they have a significantly shorter lifespan and, frankly, very off-putting stretch marks. We’re working on it at the moment, but we think it’ll take us another two weeks at least. Quoting Dr. Baofen.” Dr. Baofen was a genius that took his sweet time on these things. He would settle for no less than long-living, stretch-markless slugs that children and adults alike would enjoy. He annoyed Sajaster to no end with his bogus ETAs.
 <br>“Tell Dr. Baofen that if he takes longer than two weeks I’ll fire him.” He never would fire him.
<br>“Sounds like a plan.” The young man rose and fell with the breath that he took, knowing that no one, not even Sajaster himself, would take his threat seriously and that he would have to relay this message over the course of at least a month every other day or so.
<br>“Grace.”
<br>“Grace.”
<br>“GRACE!”
<br>“Yes sir?” Grace sat up in her seat, flustered and pink, the sound of her phone clicking off . Everyone stared kindly at her with glimpses of smiles at their lips, the way people do when they’ve been caught doing exactly the same thing.
<br>“You realize you're a temp employee right?”
<br>“Yes sir.”
<br>“Have the meeting minutes on Manager Son’s desk in fifteen minutes. Tell her to contact some more of those luxury pharmaceutical manufacturers and see if we can get them to sign a contract.”
<br>
<br>Carl Sajaster had been the CEO of Frogs for Everyone for as long as the company had existed. He was the co-founder of the company, the one who had conceived of the idea, and owned 14% of the company shares. His salary was an unprecedented amount, but he was one of those anthropological types, ones that only stored half their wealth in un-inflatable, foreign crypto currencies that couldn’t be taxed. He was charismatic if he wished to be, and threatened his employees often with cut wages and no more of the free muffins and donuts that he had delivered daily to the office, but everyone got a generous Christmas bonus at the end of the year, and contract workers like Grace would be hired full-time.
<br>It was a nice place to work, if you didn’t mind that they had to exploit loopholes in the Animal Legal Defense Fund to sell the animals. Max and Johnny had worked on that case too, when the company first began production.
<br>“This company’s animals are all produced from the sum of organic, non-living parts. Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen, and a mixture of other, smaller percentages of relevant elements. The cell does not have autonomy, nor is it even naturally produced, and cannot be reproduced organically. It can be electrically transposed into the desired shape, and sold as the company wishes as it is not technically an organism, does not endanger the consumer, and does not endanger naturally-forming wildlife if it is released into the wild.”
<br>“Endangering does not just include reproducing and overrunning. It also includes killing.”
<br>“Their throats and brains are electrically constructed to only be able to recognize and eat the food we manufacture. They’ll starve in the wild.”
<br>It was a landmark case in commercial genetic modification. Many a person online made sure that Sajaster knew that he was a disgusting demonic asshole of a person for manipulating genetic code and quote “not taking responsibility for it”, but Sajaster did not use social media, and so their cries of his immorality fell upon ears that believed the exact same things, or ears that thought the commenter should burn in hell for putting such an uneducated idea anywhere someone might see it.
<br>
<br>Yes, Frogs for Everyone was a company to be reckoned with, their growth over the past 12 years had been immense and steady. Sajaster turned around in his desk chair, tapping a pen to his lips, a metallic clink sounding every time it hit his teeth. His wife did not like this habit of his.
<br>He had been having dreams lately, recurring ones, about a frog. It was what the company called a “classic”, one with green and brown spots flecked over its back, and a soft, white belly. But this one also had a little golden three-pronged crown perched on its head, the character projected onto a black void of nothingness. The sound of a guqin meandered through space and time. The dream continued on like that, with Sajaster staring at the frog and listening to the music for what felt like, and what probably was, hours of the night. He never woke up feeling rested anymore.
<br>He thought back to his childhood, and how he’d bike to the pond behind the Wells Fargo at night and listen to the croaking of the bullfrogs and chirping of the crickets. He did that whenever he was bored and it was night and nothing was open. Sajaster remembered that he had to sit for a good 15 minutes before the night's sounds resumed their usual thrum, undisturbed by the newcomer in their midst. Lately he had thought about those frogs a lot, near constantly, when he was in his office, or in the shower, or when he heard them singing outside his bedroom. Sajaster’s phone rang. It was Dr. Baofen.
<br>“You eating lunch in the cafeteria?” He asked.
<br>“Why are you taking so damn long on those slugs?” Sajaster fired back. Baofen sighed.
<br>“We can talk about it over lunch. They’re serving taco salad today, eh?” The cafeteria served taco salad every Tuesday.
<br>“Yeah, yeah. See you in a couple of hours.”
<br>“See ya.”
<br>Andrew Baofen had been the other co-founder of the company. Back when they’d been best friends in high school and college, the two had come up with the idea after Baofen’s thesis had been about genetically and electrically modified animal cells and Sajaster, being the business major he was, thought of marketing genetically modified animals to the general public. The rest was history.
<br>
<br>Dr. Baofen was late to lunch, and Sajaster had already sat down and began eating, with the “Real Men of Genius” taco salad ad playing in his head. Dr. Baofen waved to him across the cafeteria as he got in line. Sajaster’s phone buzzed.
<br>Mr. Giant Taco Salad Inventor!, read a text from Baofen. Sajaster’s nostrils flared in amusement.
<br>“So,” Sajaster began when Baofen finally sat down, “the slugs.”
<br>“Look man, I’m not a magician. And neither are you.” he paused to take a mouthful of food, scooping mostly sour cream into his mouth and a bit of ground beef. “I always forget why I’m excited for Tuesday.” He said as he poked the mass of food with his plastic fork.
<br>“You were saying?”
<br>“Yeah. You’re not a magician, you can’t market those disgusting creatures no matter how hard you try, not like this. And no one wants a slug that’ll die in three months. So we’ve got to take our time for this one.”
<br>“You sound like you know it’ll take longer than two weeks.”
<br>“I do know. I just wanted you to quit your nagging.”
<br>“I run a company, not a research facility. What’s the real estimate?” Sajaster shook a packet of hot sauce, making sure that it was all away from the edge he opened before pouring it all over his food.
<br>“You’re not going to like it.”
<br>“Nowadays I don’t like anything you say.”
<br>“You liked my text.” Baofen took a big bite of taco salad. “We used to only buy bud light because of that ad.”
<br>“Just tell me how long?”
<br>“Month and a half.”
<br>“A month and a half? Andy, this project’s been delayed for two months already, we can’t handle any more wasted time.” Baofen chuckled, crushing some of the free tortilla chips that came with the salad into his sour cream.
<br>“It’s not wasted time if it ensures the products get sold. I’ll say it again, we aren’t magicians.”
<br>“Yeah, yeah. Take your time.” Sajaster hadn’t finished even half of his food, but he didn’t really feel hungry anymore. The oily ground beef, half a cup of sour cream, sweating cheese and slightly stale tortilla chips, on top of the stress of neither of the company’s projects being on schedule, had killed his appetite completely. He got up to leave.
<br>“I’ve got to meet Max and Johnny soon. The feds are barking up our tree again.”
<br>“Okay.” Dr. Baofen looked apologetic. “See you Sunday, okay? I’m looking forward to Martha’s cooking.”
<br>“See ya.”
<br>
<br>Sajaster’s day was not working out as he had wanted it to. He would’ve liked to hear that the slugs were nearly ready for manufacturing, that they had managed to make them have stripes and spots, and fly, and have no stretch marks and live for eternity. He would’ve at least liked to have the Create-Your-Own-Frogs Kits to have a manufacturer ready. He hadn’t felt like himself for the past couple of days. He was more irritable than usual, absentminded and coarse. His wife and daughter had begun to notice. He hadn’t been eating very much and going to bed early.
<br>“Honey, are you sure there’s nothing wrong?” Martha had asked him after she had put Rory to bed.
<br>“Stuff at work. Our projects aren’t even close to being on schedule. And I keep thinking about frogs.” She had sat down on the couch beside him, and put her arm around his shoulders.
<br>“You have to remind yourself…” She trailed off, thinking about the right things to say.
<br>“I guess.” He had said, taking a sip of his coffee, and looking for an SNL skit to watch.
<br>Then they watched “Monkey Judge” on TV.
<br>
<br>“FDA again, right?” Max said, leaning forward in his seat, flipping through some documents.
<br>________________________ (FDA sentence goes here)
<br>“Yeah. They reviewed the list of hormones and stimulants that we plan on being add-ons to the kit. They said they won’t allow some of them, like any prescription steroids.”
<br>“I know. I think modifying the quantity of steroids and sending them to the user over an extended period of time would make our job a lot easier.”
<br>“Andy said that it would have a different effect on the frogs. We don’t want that.”
<br>“You could require a background check of the user.” Jonathan said.
<br>“That’s too formal. No one will buy the kit if they have to fill out a ton of forms and have them reviewed for a month. Guardian consent is necessary for us to send them the add-ons.”
<br>“Hmmm.” Max put his hand over his mouth, eyes focused on the papers in front of him.
<br>“When do you need this case done?” Max asked.
<br>“This month.”
<br>“That’s not a lot of time, Sajaster.” Max sung, arching his eyebrows and peering at Sajaster.
<br>“I know.”
<br>
<br>The air was cold and clear, and it was nearly nighttime when Sajaster took the train, then the bus back to his house. He enjoyed pretending to be worldly. If he drove his Mercedes too much then he began to feel alienated from the world around him. The image of the untainted frog on the black of the evening sky came to his mind. He could nearly hear the gentle music surrounding it like a blanket, shielding it from anything harmful. It reminded him of the first frog, the first Frogs for Everyone frog. Although that one was pink and had three eyes. Sajaster fell asleep.
<br>
<br>Sajaster held a get-together at his house the next Sunday. Dr. Baofen came, Max, and Johnny with his wife Orla and their toddler. Sajaster’s wife cooked dinner, Spanish food, and each of the guests brought cocktail snacks or dessert. A dinner party like this wasn’t a common occurrence, but it wasn’t an uncommon one either. It happened once a month or so, depending on how much Sajaster had irritated Max and Johnny, and how many unfulfilled deadlines Dr. Baofen had given Sajaster.
<br>“What is this? A Rioja?” Max asked, swirling his wine, trying and failing to sniff it discreetly with one nostril at a time before taking a miniscule sip.
<br>“I think so, but I’m not entirely sure. Orla chose it. She’s the sommelier.” Johnny responded with a laugh.
<br>“It goes great with the tapas.” Martha chimed, nodding to Orla in acknowledgement.
<br>“Where’d Sajaster go?” Orla asked.
<br>“To check on the kids, I think.” Andy twisted his head around to look at the stairs, as if expecting Sajaster to thump down them as he said it.
<br>
<br>Sajaster had checked on the kids, but then had been lured to his room by the croaking and chirping that drifted through his bedroom window. He had left the window open that morning, after putting a spider outside. Now he had probably let a multitude of spiders in. It was drizzly and wet, and the frogs and crickets sang songs to the sky with the pattering of the rain as their accompaniment. It was otherworldly. He imagined the frog in his dreams as the conductor of the orchestra, smacking his hind leg against a rock to keep time, its crown bouncing up and down, up and down as it nodded its head.
<br>“Hon?” His wife called up from downstairs.
<br>“Coming!” He hurried down the hall (like a child caught sneaking candy. ?)
<br>“Kids are so much work.” He laughed.
<br>“Let’s toast to that!” Baofen raised his glass.
<br>“You don’t have kids Andy,” Johnny said. Everyone laughed a good, strong, dinner party laugh.
<br>
<br>The next few weeks moved predictably. The slugs were ready by the third week, much to everyone’s surprise, and they would begin production the following month. The frog-kits found a manufacturer, one that used to make over the counter drugs, and was now expanding the scope of their production. The pre-orders were through the roof. Sajaster was happy. His net-worth had increased by 0.7%.
<br>Sajaster had the frog-dream every night now. He had memorized the guqin music by heart, and he sang it in his office and at home, whenever he was alone. Rory began to pick it up too, humming it to herself as she helped her father put dishes in the dishwasher, or when her mother dropped her off at school.
<br>“What’s that?” her mother had asked Rory on the way to school.
<br>“Daddy sings it.” She propped her tiny elbows on the car window and stared at the trees passing by. She sang daddy’s song again for her mother, mimicking the pluckiness of the guqin strings, cutting a note or two short by closing her lips in the middle of it. Her mother laughed.
<br>Sajaster found himself waking up in the dead of night and going to the garage, looking for something he wasn’t sure existed. The frog with the crown plagued him as he worked. He saw the frog in every word he spoke, in everything he did. He told the marketing team that the updated logo for the frog kits should be a green and brown spotted frog with a little golden crown on top.
<br>“Scratch that,” he said immediately after, “do whatever you think would be best. Just don’t use the frog with the crown.” Halfway through making the suggestion a feeling of jealousy had torn through his entire body, making him burn and tingle. He did not want to share the image of the frog. They wouldn’t understand it, not like he did.
<br>Martha had noticed that he was a little different, the circles under his eyes fixed in place permanently, his mind always somewhere else. But he remained mostly unaltered. He was a good father and a good husband. She would always come home to find the bedroom windows open. Spiders had now infiltrated and conquered their home.
<br>“Did you sleep well?” Martha would ask, and he would reply, “I woke up once in the middle of the night, but for the most part…” trailing off, leaving her to wonder if he could not bring himself to lie.
<br>
<br>Sajaster could barely keep his eyes open during the morning meetings anymore. His eyelids weighed 1,000 pounds, his back hurt when he kept it straight, and his fingers were limp sausages that he could not maneuver to press against each other.
<br>“Sir?” Grace said. She was a permanent employee now.
<br>“Sir?”
<br>“SIR!” She yelped nervously. Sajaster jerked upwards in his seat.
<br>“Yes?”
<br>“The meeting’s over.”
<br>
<br>Sajaster requested Dr. Baofen to make him a green and brown spotted frog, one with a yellow bit of flesh that looked like a three-pronged crown. Baofen was a little bewildered. Sajaster had never wanted a frog before, or at least he had never put in a request for one.
<br>“I’m trusting you with this.” Sajaster said softly, handing him a folded colored-pencil drawing of the frog. He hummed the guqin melody.
<br>Dr. Baofen made one. And then another. Then two more, then three more. None were good enough. Each one Sajaster took home in a small cardboard carrier to put in its own terrarium in the garage. There was a cacophony of frog chirps there always now. It scared Rory every time she had to get in the car.
<br>“Carl, this is getting a little ridiculous…” Baofen said to Sajaster, handing him a cardboard frog carrier after work on a Friday. It had been two months since they’d last gotten together for dinner.
<br>“Just do it, Andy. I don’t care how long it takes.” Sajaster peeked into the cardboard box, turning his face up in disgust.
<br>“It’s all wrong. Still. All wrong.” He mumbled to himself as he tripped his way down to the parking lot below the building. The fluorescent lights shone brightly like artificial suns, all strung in a line. One of them blinked on and off.
<br>Sajaster stopped and stared at it. His eyes held open for so long that they began to sting and water. He burst into tears.
<br>Sajaster made a wide arc with his arm and slammed the carrier against the asphalt, sobbing loudly. The faint, throaty croak the box had emitted dissolved in the parking lot air. Sajaster could no longer hold his body up; his eyes closed as if they were held up by marionette strings that’d suddenly been snipped. His body crashed into itself, his shoulders sloshing together like waves, his legs buckling underneath him.
<br>
<br>The frog was there again. It was always there. Always there.
<br>The guqin music played louder than ever before, and Sajaster could no longer be sure it was the same melody. Was it even the same frog? He looked closer. The crown was melded into the frog’s skin, and the third prong of it was bent inwards.
<br>It was the frog that Dr. Baofen had just handed to him. The music became deafening. The frog opened its mouth. For the first time, it spoke:
<br>
<br>“YOU KILLED ME! YOU KILLED ME! YOU KILLED ME!” It screeched. The music came to a halt.
<br>“YOU KILLED ME! YOU KILLED ME! YOU KILLED ME!” The scream echoed in the dead air of a vacuum. It was the scream of something horribly, horrifyingly angry.
<br>
<br>Sajaster woke up on a hospital bed. His wife sat next to him. Her face flew toward him as his eyes opened.
<br>“How do you feel?” She was afraid her voice might shatter him if it was too loud.
<br>“I’m a murderer.” His eyes turned to watch the ceiling. “Where’s Rory?”
<br>“She’s getting coffee and hot chocolate with my sister.”
<br>“That’s good.”
<br>
<br>Sajaster contacted a pharmaceutical conglomerate that’d been waiting for a chance to snatch Frogs for Everyone up. The second Sajaster called they agreed to buy it for 6 times the company sales. Sajaster would sign the paperwork next week. His wife did not say anything to him about this matter. They did not need more money than they already had. Something inside her husband had very clearly broken. For now, she let him be.
<br>
<br>Sajaster spent most of his days alone at home, listening to guqin music and staring out his bedroom window. It was the middle of fall now, and Rory was at school for the better part of the day, Martha was busy with her own job, so he was left to do what he wanted most of the time. He could not picture the frog with the crown anymore, nor the guqin melody, no matter how hard he tried. He could only mimic it, draw crude drawings from his imagination, sing songs reminiscent of the real thing.
<br>After a few months, Sajaster began to forget about the whole thing and function like he was supposed to. Him and his wife fell into a steady rhythm, different than it had previously been, but just as good in a sort of way. Rory liked being driven to school by her father/dad/dy. Sometimes they would stop and buy donuts and coffee and hot chocolate before school. But Carl Sajaster never forgot, never entirely dismissed the frog with the crown from his mind. On rainy summer nights, when the frogs outside composed another symphony, he would stand and gaze gently out his bedroom window, picturing an unrecognizable frog thumping his foot along and nodding his body in time to the music. Sometimes, he swore he heard a guqin.
