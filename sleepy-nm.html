          Sleepy.<br>
          Noelle Mascera<br>
        <br>She lies there in the water,
        <br>Her immaculate face engulfed by dirt.
        <br>Her circular base shown,
        <br>her body on the side.
        <br>Her precious self can't seem to find
        <br>who she is,
        <br>obviously everyone knows she is a cone.
        <br>She protects and attacks,
        <br>she fears and heals.
        <br>But what else can she do?
        <br>Can she be more
        <br>Than what the people believe?
        <br>Sadly she'll
        <br>Never know,
        <br>she never found her password.
        <br>She gave up on cracking the code.
        <br>This was Her end,
        <br>this time she didn't turn.
        <br>And now She lies in water
        <br>as the sky gets darker.
        <br>Engulfed with shame and dirt,
        <br>she wonders Who cares?
        <br>For she isn't on the corner
        <br>Anymore.
        <br>But to everyone she just lies in the Darkening river,
        <br>with no means.
